# The switcher app

 The switcher app is available for Android Phone and Tablet.
 This app controls the light switches of someone’s house. For this exercise, we will consider a house with **four** divisions, but take in consideration that other houses may have more or less than four divisions, so the divisions list screen should be dynamic.
 These are your house’s divisions:

- Kitchen;

- Living room;

- Master bedroom;

- Guest’s bedroom.

  All lights begin in an **OFF** state. By clicking on the switch control, the division’s lights toggle between **ON** and **OFF** state.

  When you click on each division, the app should open a detail screen for the clicked division. This detail screen must present an image indicating the light status and the text **“Your** **division** **light is** **state****”** as shown on the prototypes (Next page). The images are included on the resources folder. (Prototype on next page).

  From the detail screen, you should be able to go back to the divisions list screen.
